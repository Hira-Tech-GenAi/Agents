# ðŸ¤– Understanding AI Agents and Agentic AI

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is any entity that:
- **Perceives** its environment,
- **Makes decisions** based on that perception,
- **Acts** accordingly.

### ðŸ§  Agent = Perception + Decision + Action

| Component   | Description                            | Example (Thermostat)                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Perception  | What the agent sees or senses          | Detects room temperature               |
| Decision    | What it decides based on what it sees  | Checks if the room is too hot/cold     |
| Action      | What it actually does                  | Turns on heater or AC accordingly      |

## ðŸ¦¾ What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to **AI systems that act as agents** â€” performing tasks autonomously by:
- Sensing the environment
- Making decisions
- Taking actions toward specific goals

These systems often operate in **loops** â€” constantly learning and improving their decisions.

### âœ… Real-life Example:
A **recruitment bot** that:
1. Gathers resumes (perception)
2. Filters based on skills (decision)
3. Sends interview invites (action)

## ðŸ“š Types of AI Agents

Understanding different types of agents helps in designing better AI systems. Here are **five main types**:

| Agent Type             | Description                                                                 | Example                            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ðŸ¤– Simple Reflex Agent | Acts only on **current perception**, no memory                              | Automatic room light system        |
| ðŸ§  Model-Based Agent   | Keeps track of internal state (memory) and environment                      | Robot vacuum remembering layout    |
| ðŸŽ¯ Goal-Based Agent    | Considers **goals** while choosing actions                                  | GPS choosing best route            |
| ðŸ’¸ Utility-Based Agent | Considers **multiple outcomes and their utility/value**                     | Shopping assistant maximizing deals|
| ðŸ“ˆ Learning Agent      | Learns and improves performance over time                                   | AI playing chess/self-learning bot |
